# Taxi! (drive2gather) Code #

* This code was modified from http://www.digitalbricklayers.com/2012/03/geotasklist-in-jquery-mobile-and.html

* It chronicles us building a mobile ride-sharing web app using the following technologies:

- Clojure
- Compojure
- Google App Engine
- Google Maps
- Jquery UI Map Plugin 
- Javascript
- Jquery Mobile
- Cheshire (for JSON)
- Appengine Magic

* Rationale:

- log in with your google account
- add/delete locations
- add/delete routes between locations
- request directions for a route

* Run the following to clone the Taxi project into a local repository:

    git clone git://github.com/joachimdb/Taxi.git


* Note: Work in progress!
